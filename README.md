# Warehouse Facilities
### A quick BeamNG*.Drive* mod

This mod is made by **ZdrytchX** on a whim because of how impractical it is to own a semi-trailer truck in BeamNG's Career mode.
In short this mod adds extra content and uses the built-in (by the devs themselves) locations for warehouse pickup locations.
It gets a bit crazy with using all of them as delivery locations when you're in a rush so I kept that to a minimum.
Balance-wise it's not too crazy, but best avoid the truck-destroying tungsten loadouts because lmao, they literally destroy your truck if you don't load them correctly.
I blame BeamNG's devs for not giving us a visual representitive at this time (0.31) of the cargo load layout and without the ability to view nodes using debug controls in Career mode by default, you can't which cargo box is what.
